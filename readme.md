## Implementation
This project implements the following features:
1. Quintic polynomial trajectory generation based on start, waypoint and goal
2. State visualisation based on 3D matplotlib plots
3. PD control on position and attitude error and their relevant graphs
4. Quaternion based dynamics instead of rotation/euler angles

## Dependencies
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```
